## Movie Theater Ticket Management System
This is a Movie Theater Ticket Management System web application that allows users to view available movies, check ticket availability, and purchase tickets. The project also highlights top movies based on ticket sales.

1. Display Movies: View a list of available movies in the sidebar.
2. Movie Details: Displays details such as poster, runtime, showtime, and available tickets for the selected movie.
3. Purchase Tickets: Allows users to purchase tickets if they are available.
4. Highlight Top Movies: Showcases the most popular movies based on ticket sales.
5. Persistent Data: Uses localStorage for quick access to movie data.
## Technologies Used
1. HTML: For structuring the content of the application.
2. CSS: For styling and creating a visually appealing design.
3. JavaScript: For dynamic content rendering and interactivity.
4. JSON Server: To simulate a backend for storing movie data.
## Setup Instructions
## Prerequisites
1. Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:
        Node.js (for running JSON Server)
        A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox)

## bash
git clone https://github.com/DanHacks/week-3-challange.git

cd movie-theater-system

## Install JSON Server:

├── index.html        # Main HTML file
├── style.css         # CSS file for styling
├── index.js          # JavaScript file for functionality
├── db.json           # JSON database for movie data
├── README.md         # Project documentation

## Usage
1. Run the project by opening the index.html file in a browser.
2. View the list of movies on the sidebar.
3. Click on a movie to view its details.
4. Purchase tickets using the Buy Ticket button (if available).
5. Check the Top Movies section for the most popular films.

## JSON Data Structure
The application uses a db.json file to simulate the backend. Here's a sample structure for movie data:

## json
{
  "films": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "title": "The Shawshank Redemption",
      "runtime": 142,
      "capacity": 100,
      "tickets_sold": 80,
      "showtime": "7:00 PM",
      "poster": "link_to_image.jpg"
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "title": "The Godfather",
      "runtime": 175,
      "capacity": 120,
      "tickets_sold": 60,
      "showtime": "8:00 PM",
      "poster": "link_to_image.jpg"
    }
  ]
}
## Customization
1. To add new movies, update the db.json file under the films array.
2. Customize the app's design by editing the style.css file.
